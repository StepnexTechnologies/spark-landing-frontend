            Hello! We&apos;re Sparkonomy Pte. Ltd., and we&apos;re so glad you&apos;re here and interested in what we&apos;re building.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. What This Page Is All About</h2>
            <p>
              Think of this as our &quot;coming soon&quot; page. We created it simply to share our excitement and give you a front-row seat for updates.
              It&apos;s a way for you to say &quot;keep me in the loop!&quot; while we work on the main platform. No services are being offered here just yet.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Our Promise to You (And What We Ask in Return)</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">Your trust is the most important thing to us. Here&apos;s our commitment:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Your privacy is a big deal. We will only use your email to send you updates about Sparkonomy&apos;s journey, news, and opportunities for early access. We will never sell or rent your data to others.</li>
              <li>No spam, ever. We&apos;ll only send you the good stuff.</li>
              <li>You&apos;re in control. Every email will have a simple one-click &quot;unsubscribe&quot; link. No hard feelings if you need to go!</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4">In return, by signing up, you confirm:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>You&apos;re 18 years of age or older.</li>
              <li>You&apos;re happy to receive our occasional emails.</li>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. A Quick Heads-Up About the Future</h2>
            <p>
              We are deep in building mode, and while we have a clear vision, startup life means things can pivot and evolve.
              Signing up for our waitlist keeps you informed, but it doesn&apos;t create a contract or guarantee you early access.
              The final Sparkonomy platform might even have cool new features we haven&apos;t even thought of yet!
